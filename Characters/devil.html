                <p>DEVIL, a malevolent spirit that resides within Mito. 
                    Due to a risky procedure, a suit of armour and a spirit were fused into Mito. 
                    DEVIL typically has no control over Mitoâ€™s actions, only being able to do so through possessing the armour within her. 
                    While it is in control, Mito has little to no influence on it, meaning DEVIL can cause as much chaos as it wishes without being stopped by Mito. 
                    It does still care for Mito, despite mostly desping her. 
                    D.E.V.I.L does not duel.</p>
