                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>
                    During a particularly intensive training session between
                    Ash and Rose, both sisters unlocked the potential of
                    converging their respective potentials into one autonomous
                    being - which they would name Orchid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite existing as a direct result of the fusion of both
                    Blossom sisters, Orchid is her own unique individual, with
                    her own free will independent of Ash and Rose. When Orchid
                    isn't active, both of her halves remain dormant between the
                    sisters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orchid's power level exceeds that of Ash and Rose
                    combined, whilst inheriting the skills, traits and
                    abilities of both sisters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Duels, Orchid primarily uses a World Legacy deck,
                    however she is capable of utilising Ash's Aroma Rikka
                    Rose deck or Rose's Adamancipator Fossil or Raidraptors
                    decks.
