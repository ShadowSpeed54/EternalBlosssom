                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>
                    During a particularly intensive training session between
                    Ash and Rose, both sisters unlocked the potential of
                    converging their respective potentials into one autonomous
                    being - which they would name Orchid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite existing as a direct result of the fusion of both
                    Blossom sisters, Orchid is her own unique individual, with
                    her own free will independent of Ash and Rose. When Orchid
                    isn't active, both of her halves remain dormant between the
                    sisters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orchid's power level exceeds that of Ash and Rose
                    combined, whilst inheriting the skills, traits and
                    abilities of both sisters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In dire or dangerous circumstances, Orchid is able to
                    trigger an Awakened Form&mdash;an empowered state in which
                    her power vastly exceeds her previous limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Awakened Form, Orchid's appearance changes drastically,
                    the half-cat attributes of her body replaced with a fully
                    human appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In combat, Orchid prefers to wield a sword in her Awakened
                    Form, rather than a scythe like Ash and Rose&mdash;and by
                    extension Orchid herself&mdash;use. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Duels, Orchid primarily uses a World Legacy deck,
                    however she is capable of utilising Ash's Aroma Rikka
                    Rose deck or Rose's Adamancipator Fossil or Raidraptors
                    decks. She does not Duel in her Awakened Form.
