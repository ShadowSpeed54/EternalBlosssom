                <p>
                    Ash Nightingale-Blossom is a 23-year-old half-cat girl from
                    Neo Domino City, born to her parents Lily and Cedar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She was taught the arcane secrets of magic by her mother and
                    trained in the use of a scythe by her father, alongside her
                    older sister, Rose. Similarly to her mother, Ash has a pair of pink wings that amplify her magic.
                    In Duels, Ash uses her Bloom of Life deck.
                </p>
                <p>In VRAINS, Ash goes by the alias "Virtue".</p>
